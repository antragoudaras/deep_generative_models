# Deep Generative Model Project

This project focuses on deep generative models and their ability to model the probability distribution of the data. It consists of two parts: VAE (Variational Autoencoder) and AAE (Adversarial Autoencoder).

## Part 1: VAE

The VAE folder contains scripts and README.md related to the Variational Autoencoder. The VAE is a generative model that learns to encode and decode data by approximating the underlying probability distribution. It is trained using a combination of a reconstruction loss and a regularization term.
### VAE README.md

The README.md file in the VAE folder provides detailed information about the VAE implementation, including instructions on how to run the code and explanations of the key concepts.

## Part 2: AAE

The AAE folder contains scripts and README.md related to the Adversarial Autoencoder. The AAE is another type of generative model that combines elements of both autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs). It learns to generate data by training a generator network to fool a discriminator network.


### AAE README.md

The README.md file in the AAE folder provides detailed information about the AAE implementation, including instructions on how to run the code and explanations of the key concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, please refer to the README.md files in the VAE and AAE folders for specific instructions on running the code and reproducing the results.
